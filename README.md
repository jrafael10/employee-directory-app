# employee-directory-app
This project uses the Random User Generator API  to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

This project is an interactive web page that displays data of 12 random people from the Random User Generator API. All the functionalities on this application 
are built in Vanilla ES6 JavaScript. Using the JavaScript's built-in Fetch API, the data of the 12 random people is displayed on the web page.
